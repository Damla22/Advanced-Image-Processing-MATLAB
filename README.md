# Advanced-Image-Processing-MATLAB
This repository contains MATLAB code for various image processing tasks, including image manipulation and arithmetic operations. The tasks demonstrate how to perform operations such as image scaling, mirroring, arithmetic combination, linear combination, and image rotation using different methods.

Task 1: Load and Preprocess Images
This task involves loading two images, converting them to grayscale if necessary, and resizing the second image.

Task 2: Mirroring and Arithmetic Operations
This task includes mirroring the images and performing an arithmetic operation on the mirrored input image.

Task 3: Linear Combination and Rotation
This task demonstrates performing a linear combination of two images and rotating the resulting image using bilinear interpolation and affine transformation. 

Task 4: Display Results
This task involves displaying the results of the image processing operations.

Arithmetic Operation Function
This function performs arithmetic operations on an image based on the specified technique and mode.

Linear Combination Function
